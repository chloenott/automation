# Lab 19: Automation

The goal of this lab is to produce a script that can parse out phone numbers and email addresses in a text file, and write the results to separate files (email.txt and phone_numbers.txt). The phone numbers and email addresses can be in various formats and so regex is used to parse through this variability. The format of the output is exactly "123-456-7890" for phone numbers, with an area code of 206 assumed if no area code is found. The outputs are sorted in ascending order.
